# Hello Human 👋 

I'm Ian 🕊️ , a Software Engineer located in Santiago, CL 🇨🇱.  

I know how to code in **JS** and **PHP** for a *long time* and little bit of **C++, C# , Python and Java**. 

I started coding when I was 15 years old and I never stopped learning. 

I also have *[a well spoken languages and technologies list](https://github.com/SpiritSaint/SpiritSaint/blob/main/Skills.md).*

I'm interesting in Linux, Docker and everything related to IT stacks.

*Life is a experience, live it at most as possible.*

Dogs and birds are my best friends. ***No doubt of that***.
